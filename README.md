- 👋 Hi, I’m Thea Nilsson
- 👀 I’m interested in games development, design and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on Unreal Engine 5(.0 and .1) and Unity 2021 and 2022
- 🕹️ All projects on my GitHub are in large part or entirely produced by me. Assets that I have not produced are imported or produced by group members in team projects.
- 🔜 I have more WIP projects than those posted on my GitHub. Check back later if you're interested.
- 
- 💞️ I’m currently working as a software developer but I'm looking to find new employment in the games industry
