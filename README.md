- 👋 Hi, I’m Thea Nilsson
- 👀 I’m interested in games development, design and programming
- 🌱 I’m currently studying game programming at The Game Assembly in Stockholm.
- 🕹️ All projects on my GitHub are in large part or entirely produced by me. Assets that I have not produced are imported or produced by group members in team projects.
- 🔜 I have more WIP projects than those posted on my GitHub. Check back later if you're interested.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to find employment in the games industry immediately following my education.
